# nspect Security Scan Allowlist
# This file is used to exclude OSS packages/directories that are NOT shipped with the product
# (e.g., build tools, test code, development dependencies)
#
# For vulnerability allowlisting (Not Affected cases), use Exception Tracker, NOT this file.
# See: Exception Tracker User Guide
#
# Use Case: OSS Package/directory is not shipped (ie. build or test code)
# The OSS package(s) in a directory/location should not be included in the report (and SBOM)
# due to the fact that it is not shipped with the product (ie. it is used in test or build code ONLY)

version = "1.0.0"

# If you are not adding excluded directories, remove [oss.excluded] and [[oss.excluded.directories]] both tags from file.
# [oss.excluded]
# 
# Example: Exclude vulnerabilities related to unused/tools code
# [[oss.excluded.directories]]
# paths = ['tools/3rdparty/src/cub-1.8.0/', 'tools/3rdparty/src/grpc/grpc/']
# comment = 'tools packages'
# 
# Optional: nspect_ids attribute - Useful for shared repos allow list
# nspect_ids = ['NSPECT-0000-0003']  # Only apply for specific programs

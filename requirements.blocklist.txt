# Security Blocklist: Packages that should NEVER be installed
#
# This file lists packages that are blocked due to security vulnerabilities
# or dangerous capabilities. These packages will be automatically detected
# and blocked by the dependency blocklist checker.
#
# DO NOT ADD THESE PACKAGES TO requirements.txt
# DO NOT INSTALL THESE PACKAGES IN PRODUCTION

# LangChain Experimental - Contains Python REPL vulnerabilities
# CVE-2024-38459: Unauthorized Python REPL access without opt-in
# CVE-2024-46946: Code execution via sympy.sympify
# CVE-2024-21513: Code execution via VectorSQLDatabaseChain

# LangChain (old package) - Contains path traversal vulnerability
# CVE-2024-28088: Directory traversal in load_chain/load_prompt/load_agent
# Affected: langchain <= 0.1.10, langchain-core < 0.1.29
# Note: This codebase uses langchain-core>=1.2.6 (safe, includes CVE-2025-68664 fix), but blocking
# the old langchain package prevents accidental installation
langchain<0.1.11

# LangGraph Checkpoint - RCE vulnerability in JsonPlusSerializer
# CVE-2025-64439: Remote Code Execution in JsonPlusSerializer when deserializing payloads
# Affected: langgraph-checkpoint < 3.0.0 (versions 2.1.2 and below)
# Note: This codebase uses langgraph-checkpoint>=3.0.0 (safe), but blocking vulnerable versions
# prevents accidental installation of old versions
langgraph-checkpoint<3.0.0

# LangGraph SQLite Checkpoint - RCE vulnerability (uses vulnerable langgraph-checkpoint)
# CVE-2025-64439: Remote Code Execution in JsonPlusSerializer
# Affected: langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite < 3.0.0 (depends on langgraph-checkpoint < 3.0.0)
# Note: We don't use SQLite checkpoint (we use in-memory state), but blocking prevents
# accidental installation. The vulnerability is in the base langgraph-checkpoint package.
langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite<3.0.0

# Other potentially dangerous packages
# (Add more as needed)
